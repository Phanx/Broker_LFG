Description

	DataBroker clone of the default UI's LFG minimap button.

	It provides all the same functionality as the default UI button,
	with the addition of being visible even while you aren't using the
	LFG system, at which time it can be clicked on to open the LFD/LFR
	window.

Usage

	There are no options. It "just works".

Localization

	Compatible with all locales.

	Translated into English. If you'd like to provide a translation for
	the confirmation message, post a comment on the download page.
