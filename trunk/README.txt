Description
-----------

Broker_LFG is a DataBroker clone of the default UI’s LFG minimap button.

It provides all the same functionality as the default UI button, with
the addition of being visible even while you aren’t using the LFG
system, at which time it can be clicked on to open the LFD/LFR window.


Usage
-----

There are no options. It “just works”.


Localization
------------

Compatible with English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Português, Русский,
한국어, 简体中文, and 正體中文 game clients.

Translated into English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Русский, and 简体中文.
