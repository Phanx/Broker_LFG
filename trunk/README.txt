Broker_LFG
==========

Basic LFG launcher button for your DataBroker display.

While you are in a Dungeon Finder, Raid Finder, Scenario Finder, or
Battleground queue or group, you can click the icon to open the queue
panel, or right-click the icon to access the LFG action menu (leave
queue, teleport to dungeon, etc), or hover over the icon to see your
current queue/group status.

While you are not in a queue or LFG group, left-click the window to open
the Dungeon Finder window, right-click to open the Raid Finder window,
and middle-click or shift-click to open the Scenarios window.

There are no options. It "just works".
